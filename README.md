# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of Analysis
* The purpose of this project was to complete an analysis on the employees for the company Pewlett-Hackard.  
* This company is anticipating many employees retiring in the coming years, so they wanted to know a couple of things:
  * The number of employees retiring by title
  * The number of employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program where they are not quite to retirement age and can mentor the next generation of employees
## Results
* There were four major findings that came from this analysis:
  * There are 90,398 employees that are at retirement age
  * Of the 90,000 people eligible for retirement, only 2 have jobs at the Manager Level
  * The majority of people retiring (57,668 or 64%) have jobs at the Senior Level
  * There are 1,549 people at the company who are eligible to participate in the Mentorship Program.
